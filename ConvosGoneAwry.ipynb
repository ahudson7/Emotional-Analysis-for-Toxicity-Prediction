            "422_1.a Well, I think that sincerely my behavior was not the correct one for a tennis player. I think that I committed errors. I said the Big F many times. The first warning I didn't realize that he gave me a warning, and that's why I was so surprised when he told me I had to go to the other side and I had a point penalty. Really the first warning, I didn't hear that. Carlos, I respect him a lot. I think he's a really good chair umpire, one the best ones. He knows that. We talked about that many times. Secondly, there are players like me, which normally have decent behavior. We are not disrespectable players or we don't throw the racquet and we don't say the Big F. Except for today. Today I recognized that I was very nervous. I wanted to say to Carlos that the rules should be the same for every single player. I'm really tired of seeing players that behave really badly on the court and nothing happens. Perhaps there are players like me or anyone else that we might have a bad day and they punish us. The rules are for everyone. It cannot be that there are players we're not going to give names  they behave badly and nothing happens. That's what I don't like. It's a general thought. The chair ump has to enforce the rules, and if you have to expel a player from the court, then they have to do it. With us, players that normally have good behavior, like Rafa with the time. It's true he's slow sometimes, but the rules are there for everyone. Time and conduct, everything. Today I said, Carlos, I recognize my behavior was not the best today, but I want to have the same rule for every player. There are players that don't behave properly and nothing happens. He said, You're right. The rules are the same for everyone and I try to judge everyone the same way. That's what happened. That's all.\n",

So I'm completely comfortable with whatever people want to say, negative or positive, about me.  That's what I signed up for when I entered professional sports.

Just being associated with me brings them into the public spotlight.  That was always tough for me. So to put my family and my friends in this public of a situation, I wanted to make sure they were okay with it.  It was really partly a tribute to my dad and my friends for how much they helped me.  So I wanted to give them so much credit. Because now I'm getting a ton of the credit and adulation for comeback and everything that I've done since 2004, and I wanted people to know that it wasn't just me.  It's not just me out there on the court.  It's all the fans, it's all the friends of mine that cooked me dinners, it's all the friends that stopped by just to pick my day up when I was maybe a little down.  I wanted to make sure they got that credit. When they all were okay with it and they all said that it's fine, then I'm really glad people got to know that.

I remember once speaking to Wayne Ferreira who I was playing doubles with that year actually. He said he used to serve and volley always first serve, 50% of the second serve. And towards the end of his career at Wimbledon, he used to serve and volley 50% of his first serve and not anymore on his second serve. You wonder, how in the world has that happened? Have we become such incredible return players or can we not volley anymore or is it just a combination of slower balls, slower courts? I think it's definitely a bit of a combination of many things. If I look back, I think we definitely had many more great volley players in the game back then. When you do have that, you are forced to move in, as well, because you don't want to hit passing shots against a great volleyer over and over again. But because we don't have that as much anymore, everybody's content staying at the baseline. A bit unfortunate, I think, because I love guys moving in, like a Melzer match today who throws in the occasional serve and volley. You have to throw in great passing shots. It's unfortunate for the games. Unfortunately, they've slowed down everything, indoors, grass. Everything has become so slow, I think that is a bit of a pity.\n",

If I had said three, four, five years ago that my goal is to be top 10 in the world, I don't think I would have made it here.  I set smaller goals, attainable goals, each day.  Those are always just to get better. My goals mainly circle around the things I can control:  practice, working as hard as I can, being as prepared as I can, being as professional as I can on the court for practice and matches, just keeping my head up in every situation. I feel like I've gotten a lot better at that, and that's gotten me to where I am.  I'm definitely realistic in the fact that if I play Roger, he's the favorite.
